# DZIFA

### To run it
```npm install```
```npm run start```

### What is the problem we are trying to solve ?

Simple everyday life editing take too much time to do when using applications like photoshop.
Online platforms have interfaces that are sometimes too complex or not very intuitive


### The solution

Dzifa is our solution. A task oriented chat interface.
Why? 
Dzifa knows a number of tasks it can do on top of the cloudinary api.
A chat interface is very intuitive


### Technologies used

Microservice architecture: (nlp flask framework, editing node framework, image management on cloudinary)
NLP: built from python, numpy and sklearn using cosine similarity with a database 
Cloudinary: extensive use. More than just image management, extensive use of the transformations
APIs: used 4 cloudinary and built 2 APIs


### Limitations
Difficulty with the cloud JS library, had to go for NodeJS
NLP platforms are hard to customize and sometimes
Integration of the multiple platforms and APIs together can be complex

### Way forward
More tasks and better existing tasks
Voice interface
Friendlier interface
